- **Custom optimization reports** - From other tools
- **Scanned controller displays** - With clear text

### How to Upload Settings

1. **Locate the PDF Upload Area**
   - In Step 1 (Vehicle Information), scroll to the bottom
   - Look for the "Current Settings (Optional)" section
   - You'll see a drag-and-drop area with a cloud upload icon

**[Screenshot: PDF upload area with drag-and-drop interface]**

2. **Prepare Your PDF**
   - Ensure your PDF contains controller function settings
   - Common formats include "F.1: 255", "Function 1: 255", or tabular data
   - PDFs should be clear and readable (not heavily pixelated)

3. **Upload the PDF**
   - **Method 1**: Click "Upload PDF" and select your file
   - **Method 2**: Drag and drop your PDF file onto the upload area
   - **Method 3**: Click anywhere in the dashed area to browse files

**[Screenshot: File selection dialog showing supported PDF files]**

4. **AI Analysis Process**
   - The AI will automatically analyze your PDF
   - You'll see a progress indicator: "AI is analyzing your PDF..."
   - Analysis typically takes 10-30 seconds

**[Screenshot: PDF analysis in progress with spinner animation]**

5. **Review Analysis Results**
   - Once complete, you'll see a green success message
   - The system will display how many settings were found
   - Example: "‚úÖ Settings Analyzed - Found 45 controller functions"

**[Screenshot: Successful PDF analysis showing extracted settings count]**

### Understanding Analysis Results

The AI extraction will show:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### PDF Upload Problems

**Issue: "No valid settings found in PDF"**
- **Solution**: Ensure PDF contains function numbers (F.1, F.2, etc.)
- **Check**: PDF text is selectable, not just an image
- **Try**: Use "Enhanced PDF Analyzer" option for complex formats

**Issue: PDF upload fails or times out**
- **Solution**: Check internet connection
- **Verify**: File size is under 10MB
- **Alternative**: Try converting PDF to different format

#### Vehicle Information Validation

**Issue: "Incompatible controller and motor combination"**
- **Solution**: Verify actual vehicle specifications
- **Check**: Controller model number on physical unit
- **Contact**: Dealer for confirmation if uncertain

**Issue: Speed classification warnings**
- **Cause**: Entered speed may affect legal classification
- **Review**: Local regulations for your area
- **Consider**: Legal implications of speed modifications

#### Optimization Failures

**Issue: "Optimization failed - insufficient data"**
- **Solution**: Complete all required vehicle information
- **Verify**: Motor and battery specifications are accurate
- **Try**: Upload current settings PDF for baseline

**Issue: Results show mostly "No Change" recommendations**
- **Cause**: Current settings may already be well-optimized
- **Alternative**: Try different optimization mode
- **Consider**: More aggressive performance settings if safe

3. **Backup First**: Always save original settings
4. **Double-Check**: Verify each setting before applying

#### After Modifications
1. **Gradual Testing**: Start with low-speed, short-distance tests
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for unusual behavior
3. **Temperature Checks**: Motor and controller heat levels
4. **Regular Inspection**: Ongoing safety assessment

### Critical Safety Limits

#### Never Exceed These Values
- **Maximum Current**: Don't exceed motor nameplate ratings
- **Voltage Limits**: Stay within battery and controller specifications
- **Temperature Thresholds**: Monitor motor and controller heat
- **Speed Limits**: Respect legal and safety speed limits

#### Warning Signs to Stop Immediately
- **Excessive Heat**: Motor or controller overheating
- **Unusual Sounds**: Grinding, squealing, or electrical arcing
- **Erratic Behavior**: Unpredictable speed or braking
- **Smoke or Burning Smells**: Immediate safety hazard

### Legal Considerations

#### Speed and Classification
- **Golf Cart (‚â§19 MPH)**: Local roads only, no license required
- **LSV (20-25 MPH)**: Some public roads, may require license
- **Higher Speeds**: May require special permits or registration
